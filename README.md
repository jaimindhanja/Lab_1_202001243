## Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.


### Functional Requirement : 
 1) Maintaining the database of the books available in the library.
 2) Member can borrow book online and offline.
 3) Menber can extend the date of borrowing book.
 4) Adding & removing book can be done using software.
 5) member should have the option of searching a specific book if the library system is digital.
 6) Authentication of member should be done. If the user is new then the verification should be done through email.
 7) In the event of a cyberattack, the system should shut down and the data should be secure.
 8) Only use the institute wifi to connect to the website that processes the data.

### Non-functional Requirement : 
 1) The user must be able to obtain accurate facts and not false information.
 2) In order for users to use it easily, the user interface should be as simple as feasible.
 3) The programme ought to be able to be used by the user in several languages.
 4) Regular intervals should be used for the maintenance.
 5) If several users are utilising the system simultaneously, it shouldn't crash.
 6) The user should have access to the software up until the library is opened.


## Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

### Scope : 
 1) It contains fast alerts for them as well as sound features for those who wear hearing aids.
 2) It works on Android devices which works on real time.
 3) The application invloves the use of AI.

### Feature : 
 1) The user is able to track the daily activity in the application.
 2) The user should be logged in using authentication.
 3) It operates using software that is based on an application that may be used on Android-powered devices.
 4) The sounds that are available in the apps should be voice controlled.
 5) The application should not have a time limit to use.
 6) The data should be accurately tracked regularly.

### Non-Functional Requirement
 1) Between the user and the application, the data should remain private.
 2) Any emergency circumstance shouldn't cause the programme to crash.
 3) The user should provide certain information throughout the sign-in process, such as their age and gender.
 4) The programme should display the user's data with a delay of no more than a few milliseconds.
 5) The user interface should be as minimal as possible to be easily accessible.
